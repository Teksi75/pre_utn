## Verification Report

**Change**: challenge-attempt-student-id
**Version**: N/A
**Mode**: Strict TDD
**Re-verification**: post-critical-fix (stale readinessBySkill isolation)

### Completeness

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Tasks total | 16 |
| Tasks complete | 16 |
| Tasks incomplete | 0 |

All tasks checked. Task 4.4 (manual rollback smoke) verified by source inspection: `ChallengeAttempt.studentId` is additive; `parseAdvancedProgress` only checks `Array.isArray(obj.challengeAttempts)` and ignores extra fields; storage key and top-level shape unchanged.

### Assertion Quality

**Assertion quality**: ✅ All assertions verify real behavior

Audited all 3 test files modified by this change:
- `src/lib/__tests__/advanced-practice-progress.test.ts` (35 tests): No tautologies, no ghost loops, no type-only assertions. All assertions verify concrete values (studentId strings, attempt counts, readiness percentages, storage contents).
- `src/components/practice/challenges/__tests__/useChallengeFlow.test.ts` (29 tests): Pure state machine tests assert phase transitions, index values, and evaluation objects. Two additional tests inject a mock `addChallengeAttempt` (via `simulateHookOnAnswer` helper) that returns `{ ok:false, reason:"missing-active-profile" }` and `{ ok:false, reason:"storage-error" }` respectively, verify the mock was called, and assert the state still transitions to feedback. No implementation-detail coupling.
- `tests/e2e/fixtures/__tests__/advanced-practice.test.ts` (3 tests): Builder shape assertions with concrete values.

No banned patterns found.

### Spec Compliance Matrix

#### `challenge-exercises` spec

| Requirement | Scenario | Test | Result |
|-------------|----------|------|--------|
| Student-Scoped Challenge Attempts | new challenge attempt belongs to active student | `1.1 — persists with studentId === getActiveStudentId()` | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| Student-Scoped Challenge Attempts | no active student blocks challenge write | `1.2 — no active profile → blocked; storage untouched` | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| Student-Scoped Challenge Attempts | legacy anonymous attempts remain loadable safely | `1.3 — legacy anonymous attempts load without throwing` + `1.3b — remain in persisted JSON` | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| Student-Scoped Challenge Attempts | readiness does not leak across students | `1.5 — ignores cross-student + anonymous` + 4 stale-readiness isolation tests | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| Student-Scoped Challenge Attempts | storage contract remains compatible | `loadAdvancedProgress` tests + fixture round-trip tests | ✅ COMPLIANT |

#### `student-local-identity` spec

| Requirement | Scenario | Test | Result |
|-------------|----------|------|--------|
| Anonymous Attempts Forbidden | addAttempt without active profile writes nothing | *Inherited*: `practice-progress.test.ts:188` — pre-existing gate, not changed by I-21 | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| Anonymous Attempts Forbidden | diagnostic save without active profile writes nothing | *Inherited*: `diagnostic-storage.test.ts:147` — pre-existing gate, not changed by I-21 | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| Anonymous Attempts Forbidden | challenge attempt without active profile writes nothing | `1.2 — no active profile → blocked; storage untouched` | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| Challenge Progress Uses Active Profile | active profile reads only its challenge progress | `1.4 — filters to studentId === activeStudentId` | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| Challenge Progress Uses Active Profile | legacy anonymous data does not contaminate a different student | `1.4` + `1.5` + stale-readiness isolation suite | ✅ COMPLIANT |

**Compliance summary**: 10/10 scenarios compliant

### Correctness (Static Evidence)

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| `studentId` on `ChallengeAttempt` | ✅ Implemented | `readonly studentId: string` added to interface; `ChallengeAttemptInput = Omit<ChallengeAttempt, "studentId">` |
| Gate writes on active profile | ✅ Implemented | `getActiveStudentId()` checked first; returns `{ ok: false, reason: "missing-active-profile" }` |
| Stamp `studentId` on writes | ✅ Implemented | `{ ...attempt, studentId: activeStudentId }` in `addChallengeAttempt` |
| Filter reads by active student | ✅ Implemented | `loadAdvancedProgress` filters `challengeAttempts` by `a.studentId === activeStudentId` |
| Legacy anonymous preservation | ✅ Implemented | Anonymous attempts remain in persisted JSON; excluded from active-student reads |
| Readiness recomputation (ALL skills) | ✅ Implemented | `recomputeAllReadiness()` pure helper derives readiness from filtered attempts; used in both `loadAdvancedProgress` and `addChallengeAttempt` |
| Stale readiness elimination | ✅ Implemented | Neither `loadAdvancedProgress` nor `addChallengeAttempt` trust persisted `readinessBySkill`; both recompute from filtered active-student attempts |
| Storage error handling | ✅ Implemented | Try/catch returns `{ ok: false, reason: "storage-error" }` |
| Hook compatibility | ✅ Implemented | `useChallengeFlow` uses `ChallengeAttemptInput` (no `studentId`); `addChallengeAttempt` call ignores result for state transition |
| Fixture compatibility | ✅ Implemented | `buildAdvancedPracticeFixture` passes through `challengeAttempts` verbatim |

---

### Coherence (Design)

| Decision | Followed? | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Active identity source: `getActiveStudentId` from `student-profile-storage` | ✅ Yes | Imported and used directly |
| Storage topology: same key, same shape, additive `studentId` | ✅ Yes | `pre-utn.advanced-practice.v1` unchanged |
| Legacy anonymous data: preserve in storage, exclude from active reads | ✅ Yes | `loadAdvancedProgress` filters; `addChallengeAttempt` appends to full list preserving legacy |
| Readiness source: recompute from active-student attempts | ✅ Yes | `recomputeAllReadiness()` derives from filtered attempts; never trusts persisted map |
| Hook compatibility: blocked result does not break state machine | ✅ Yes | `useChallengeFlow` uses `ChallengeAttemptInput` adapter; state transition independent of persistence result |

---

### Scope Discipline

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| No I-23 adapter boundary / `getActiveProfileId` extraction | ✅ Clean |
| No Supabase / Auth / RLS | ✅ Clean |
| No `trackId` / `subjectId` / attempt model unification | ✅ Clean |
| No UI redesign or new challenge content | ✅ Clean |

### Critical Fix Verification: Stale readinessBySkill Isolation

The original verify-report flagged WARNING #1: `addChallengeAttempt` spread `parsed?.readinessBySkill` and only recomputed the affected skill, leaking stale cross-student entries.

**Fix applied**: Extracted `recomputeAllReadiness()` pure helper. Both `loadAdvancedProgress()` and `addChallengeAttempt()` now call it with filtered active-student attempts. Neither function reads or trusts the persisted `readinessBySkill` map.

**Verification evidence** (5 new tests):

| Test | What it proves |
|------|----------------|
| `loadAdvancedProgress discards persisted readinessBySkill from other students` | Stored student-b readiness (100) does not appear when student-a has zero attempts → `{}` |
| `loadAdvancedProgress discards persisted readinessBySkill from anonymous attempts` | Stored anonymous readiness (100) does not leak to student-a → `{}` |
| `loadAdvancedProgress recomputes readiness only from active student attempts` | Mixed A/B attempts with stale 50 → recomputed to 100 for student-a |
| `addChallengeAttempt does not preserve stale readiness from other skills/students` | After adding attempt for complejos, stale valor_absoluto entry from student-b is absent |
| `addChallengeAttempt recomputes all skills from active student, not just affected skill` | After adding third complejos attempt, readiness is 67 (not spread from old map), and student-b's valor_absoluto is absent |

**Verdict**: Fix is complete and verified. The stale readinessBySkill leak is eliminated.

---

### Issues Found

**CRITICAL**: None

**WARNING**: None (previous WARNING #1 resolved by critical fix)

**SUGGESTION**:
1. The fixture test suite (`advanced-practice.test.ts`) does not test `studentId` handling — it tests basic builder shape. Consider adding a fixture test that seeds attempts with `studentId` and verifies the builder preserves them, matching task 4.1's intent.

---

### Verdict

**PASS**

All 10 spec scenarios have covering tests that pass at runtime. All 16 tasks complete. Gates green (test 2497/2497, typecheck clean, build clean). No scope creep. Design decisions followed. The critical stale readinessBySkill leak has been fixed and verified with 5 dedicated isolation tests. Both `loadAdvancedProgress` and `addChallengeAttempt` now recompute `readinessBySkill` from filtered active-student attempts via the pure `recomputeAllReadiness()` helper, eliminating the cross-student/anonymous readiness leakage path.
